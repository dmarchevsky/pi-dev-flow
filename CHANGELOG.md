# Changelog

Format: newest first. `Unreleased` collects what's merged but not yet tagged.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0]
### Added
- `flow init` analyzes the project and writes a starter `.dev-flow/project.json` — default branch from git, package manager from `packageManager`/lockfiles, `test`/`build`/`run` from npm scripts, or cargo/go/python (uv/poetry/pytest) conventions. Existing config is never overwritten; the report shows what was guessed and what was left empty.
- `.dev-flow/` now ignores itself and everything under it via a folder-local `.gitignore` containing `*`.

### Changed
- `flow init` no longer edits the tracked root `.gitignore`.

## [0.1.0]
- Initial release: stage gates (`start`/`approve`/`test`/`verify`/`release-done`/`cleanup`/`deploy`) over a per-feature state machine, tool-call guardrails (main-branch protection, worktree confinement, untouchable state), per-turn stage context, the `dev-flow` agent skill, and the main-branch `pre-commit` hook.
